# Passwordgenerator

In this project we created our own password generator using the knowledge we have gained from learning Jeavascript.

first I defined all the letters, symbols, and numbers that were defined in the instructions by placing them into different variables. To randomize the numbers I entered a math.random function as well as a math.floor function to round it down to the nearest whole number.

After that I choose a function where I can get a random function and element from an array as defined in the project's assignment details 

In my generate password function I placed my window prompts and my if statements if the user choose something outside the parameters. At the end of the code I created my for loop in order to ensure that the password would function properly.
